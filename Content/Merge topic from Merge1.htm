        <p>The Saints have tried offering the vaccination carrot long enough, and now the team is breaking out the stick.</p>
        <p>Days after becoming the first team to require a vaccination or a 72-hour negative test to attend a game, the Saints raised the bar by announcing that the team would not offer refunds to ticketholders who refuse to provide proof of the vaccine or the test. It's a significant step forward in positioning vaccination as the "norm." The ticketholder now has the burden of proving their virus-free status, rather than the team accommodating their choice not to be vaccinated.</p>
